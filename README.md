# Welcome
  *Have you ever encountered a problem when you want to switch a track or turn it down in spotify,  
  but for this you need to move the mouse to another monitor, or press win tab to select a window and do a billion actions?  
  This script allows you to do this in 1 keyboard shortcut without interfering with your gameplay.*  

## ABOUT
  *you have 2 bat files named alt and shift,    
  which determines the key combination via alt or via shift.    
  That is, you have variations of pressing (for example, shift + vk_right(right arrow)) or (alt + vk_right(rightarrow))* 

### BUTTONS SET
**do not forget that to work you need to use **key reading** simply (alt + right_down (right arrow) or (shift + right_arrow(right arrow))**  

  **SPACE** - *Stop playing / Start playing*  
  **Right Arrow** - *Next track*  
  **Left Arrow** - *Back track*  
  **UP Arrow** - *Volume +*  
  **Down Arrow** - *Volume -*  

### NOT VIRUS!
 **The antivirus software may swear, as keyboard control is involved.(keyboard shortcuts that are activated in the system)**
